# Consumer Complaint Database API

### A resource for searching complaints submitted to the CFPB

Each week the CFPB sends thousands of consumersâ€™ complaints about financial products and services to companies for response. Those complaints are [published](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/) on our website after the company responds or after 15 days, whichever comes first.

The API allows automation of the same filtering and searching functions offered to website visitors.

Detailed documentation for the search API can be found [here](https://cfpb.github.io/ccdb5-api/documentation/index.html).
