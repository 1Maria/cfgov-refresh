    <h1>Why financial well-being?</h1>
    <p class="lead-paragraph">
        We developed the Financial Well-Being Scale to help answer
        an important question: Am I better off than before?
    </p>
    <p>
        When people take action to improve their financial lives—and
        when they get help from others, maybe through a
        friend, coach, book, or financial services professional—one of the
        key questions they ask themselves afterward is,
        “Am I better off than before?”
    </p>
    <p>
        To answer that question, you can
        <a href="../">use the CFPB’s financial well-being questionnaire</a>
        and your resulting score.
        Together, they let you accurately and consistently quantify,
        and therefore observe, something that is not directly observable—the
        extent to which your financial situation and the financial capability
        that you have developed provide you with security and freedom of choice.
    </p>

    <h2>What is financial well-being?</h2>
    <p>
        Because each person’s situation is unique and subjective,
        it is hard to describe financial well-being using only numbers
        like income, net worth, or credit score.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, we asked people around the country
        what financial well-being meant to them, and we listened.
    </p>
    <p>
        We learned that financial well-being means
        having financial security and financial freedom of choice,
        in the present and in the future.
        Your sense of financial security and freedom is very personal.
        That’s why people with the same income, credit scores, or education
        can have very different levels of financial well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the CFPB, we work to help consumers like you take control
        of their financial lives to reach their own life goals,
        achieve financial peace of mind,
        and avoid pitfalls that can derail them.
        The ultimate goal of our work is to help you
        improve your financial well-being.
    </p>

    <h2>How can the financial well-being questionnaire help you?</h2>
    <p>
        Because financial well-being is deeply personal,
        we developed a scale (that is, a questionnaire and a scoring method)
        that can help you find out how much
        your financial situation and money choices
        provide you with security and freedom of choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        The comparison of your score to others’ scores
        is made possible by our national survey.
        In late 2016, CFPB fielded the financial well-being scale
        in a nationwide survey of U.S. adults for the first time.
        With the results of the survey, you can compare your score to
        the average financial well-being of all adults in similar circumstances.
